# Epistemic Prediction and Planning with Implicit Coordination for Multi-Robot Teams in Communication Restricted Environments
This code is a small example implementation of the code from the paper "Epistemic Prediction and Planning with Implicit Coordination for Multi-Robot Teams in Communication Restricted Environments" published in ICRA 2023

#### Running the code (requires MATLAB - previously tested on 2023a)
Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/laurenbramblett/epistemic-planning-mrs-icra23
```
Open the file `main.m` and press run.

Variables can be changed in the `main.m` script on lines `4-34`. Additional variables including the partially-known map, agent parameters and dynamics, and the map can be manipulated in the `utils/InitializeSimEnvironment.m` script

#### Example Video
